# website_components
This repository holds responsive front-end components that can be pasted into any website. They are simple and easy to restyle.
The components are built in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and are meant to use as little coding as possible.

HOW TO USE:

Each component is made so that they can be copied, pasted, and redesigned into any basic static website. You will probably want to change file names and sources in your HTML file.

Here are codepens for each available component:

I am planning on adding more components and more styles to this library.
